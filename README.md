# BiooBang-v1

This repository contains codes for BiooBang, which is an advanced biological language model designed to integrate **protein amino acid sequences** and **mRNA coding sequences (CDS)** within a unified framework. Built on a **Transformer-based prefix decoder** architecture, BiooBang leverages the principles of natural language processing to treat protein and CDS sequences as biological “languages,” enabling self-supervised learning for comprehensive training.
